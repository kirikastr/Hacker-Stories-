Our project computer game " Hacker Stories‚Äù in this game there is a hacker who helps protect the network city for IT Specialists from evil coronaviruses 
that want to destroy the city and take power over the city by stealing valuable data.
The hacker finds them and protects the city.
The project is written using the Python programming language and the map editor Tiled Map. 
This game is designed for people 12-18 years old. The game helps you learn the prog. Python language.
And I would also like to add that the game is on the demo version.

Thanks.
